# TimeTraveling-Strategy-game

This is a game that I made for fun. It's supposed to be a time based strategy game. In this game, you'll be allocated a specific amount of "frames" every one of your turns. During these turns, you can use these frames to do actions like move, melee attack, special movement techniques, speical attacks, and use your gun. But, your usage of these frames will determine the passing of time. For example, if an enemy bullet moves one space every 5 frames, and you use an action that costs 10 frames, the enemy bullet will move two spaces. Your goal is to use this power to your advantage to accomplish goals throughout levels. I'm planning to have the enmemy turn phase play out in a general turn based strategy manner, where all enemy units make their moves and attacks. But, when it switches to the player's turn, everything will freeze, and it'll be up to them to use their time manipulation ability to get themselves out of the situation that they've been put in. This project is still in very early development. I haven't worked on it in a bit, but I may come back to working on it in later time.
